These are my notes on the project task page. This project is called "Demographic Data Analyzer." The URL for the page which these notes are on is https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/data-analysis-with-python-projects/demographic-data-analyzer

- There are two courses which we must complete before doing this: 
	-> Python for Everybody Video Course (14 hours) <- https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/python-for-everybody/
	-> How to Analyze Data with Python Pandas (10 hours) <- https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-analyze-data-with-python-pandas/

- We first clone the project boilerplate files in a Gitpod environment 
- There is the demographic_data_analyzer.py file in this
- We are given a 1994 Census database -> and then asked to use Pandas to answer different questions about this database, in this .py file
- We also have different unit tests 

- The aims are:
	-> Complete the course material <- This was a pre-requisite for the previous project in the certification course 
	-> Clone the project boilerplate files in a Gitpod environment 
	-> Open the demographic_data_analyzer.py file <- This is where our Python goes 
	-> Answer the questions about the census data with Pandas
	-> Complete the unit tests on the .py file we create
		-> These unit tests are in the test_module.py and main.py files 
		-> One imports the modules from the other 
	-> Once the unit tests are passing, we push our solution to a GitHub repository 
	-> Then we take the link for the GitHub repository and paste it into the same page which these notes are made on 
		-> The URL for this is at the top of this txt file 
-> So we are cloning the boilerplate files, looking in the project demographic_data_analyzer.py file, answering these questions about the census data with Pandas:

		- How many people of each race are represented in this dataset? This should be a Pandas series with race names as the index labels. (race column)
		- What is the average age of men?
		- What is the percentage of people who have a Bachelor's degree?
		- What percentage of people with advanced education (Bachelors, Masters, or Doctorate) make more than 50K?
		- What percentage of people without advanced education make more than 50K?
		- What is the minimum number of hours a person works per week?
		- What percentage of the people who work the minimum number of hours per week have a salary of more than 50K?
		- What country has the highest percentage of people that earn >50K and what is that percentage?
		- Identify the most popular occupation for those who earn > 50K in India.

	-> Running unit tests in other .py files, then pushing our solution to GitHub and submitting the link to its repository
