# Demographic-Data-Analyser-Project
### Abstract
I independently completed freeCodeCamp's [Data Analysis with Python](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python#data-analysis-with-python-course) certification, to invest in my data analytics skills with Python. This repository contains my independent problem-solving work as part of the [second project](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/data-analysis-with-python-projects/demographic-data-analyzer) in this curriculum. CSV data for a 1994 census ([adult.data.csv](https://github.com/franpanteli/Data-Analysis-Python-Demographic-Data-Analyser-Project/tree/main/data)) was first provided. The `calculate_demographic_data` function was written, which performed calculations on this data to answer nine questions.
